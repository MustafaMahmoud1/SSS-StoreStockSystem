# Business Logic Layer

The Business Logic Layer (BLL), also known as the domain layer, is responsible for executing the business rules and logic specific to the application. It acts as an intermediary between the Data Access Layer and the Presentation Layer, processing data received from the DAL before it's passed to the presentation layer, and vice versa.
