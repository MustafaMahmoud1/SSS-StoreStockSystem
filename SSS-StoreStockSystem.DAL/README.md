# Data Access Layer

The Data Access Layer (DAL) is a crucial component of n-tier architecture. Its primary purpose is to interact with the database or any other persistent storage system to retrieve, manipulate, and store data. This layer provides a simplified and centralized way to access data that is essential for the application's operations.
